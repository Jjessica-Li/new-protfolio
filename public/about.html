<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Mia Zhao Dangerfield. I am an Aussie who is turning 4 next month. My daddy is Adam and my mummy is Junjie. They are from different countries. Daddy is the same as me from Australia but my mummy is from China.

<p>On 25/02/2023 me and my mummy went to China to visit her parents. I finally got to see my Wai Po who is my grandma. She is really nice and spent a lot of time with us and took me to every playground in her area. Now She is in Australia with us. Because my mummy needs to study to be a developer and Wai Po can take care of me and spend more time with me</p>

<p>Back in China, I met my 4 cousins. My chinese skill is so good now thanks to them. We are similar age so we could play very well together</p>
